        <p class = "fade-up delay-2"> I'm Phi Nguyen, an aspiring media artist and designer with a growing passion for visual story telling, design, and digital creativity. 
            My work will explore how ideas can be communicated through compelling visuals and thoughtful design choices.
        </p>

        <p class = "fade-up delay-3">
            I am especially interested in creative problem solving by finding innovative ways to merge my artistic vision with solutions. 
            This portfolio will reflect my journey so far and will be a space to share projects that showcase my developing skills.
        </p>

        <p class = "fade-up delay-4">
            Outside of my academic and creative work, I enjoy sewing, going to the gym, and learning new languages. 
            These hobbies not only enrich my personal life but also influence my artistic process by encouraging 
            discipline, attention to detail, and curiosity about different cultures and perspectives.
