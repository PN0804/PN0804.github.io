        <h2> Adobe Indesign </h2>
        <i> <h3> Casa Bonita Flyer Design </i> &lpar;2025&rpar; by Phi Nguyen </h3>

        <p>
            For this project, I set out to challenge my Adobe InDesign skills by designing a vacation flyer with a one week deadline. I chose the destination, Casa Bonita, as the subject out of inspiration of its portrayal in the show South Park, where it was depicted to be and extraordinary destination. Through this process, I gained practical experience in layout design, typography, and visual hierarchy. Practicing balance between imagery with text helped create a visually appealing and informative flyer. The time limit not only forced me to learn to time manage myself but also refine my workflow. <br>

        <i> <h3> Krusty Burger Menu Design </i> &lpar;2025&rpar; by Phi Nguyen </h3>
       
        <p> 
            In this project, I created themed trifold menu inspired by Krusty Burger from The Simpsons. I chose this concept because the exaggerated yet humorous branding from the show offered a fun challenge in translating a fictional restaurant into a real cohesive menu. Through the process. I was able to gain hands on experience with layout organization, typographic pairing, and establish a strong visual design. Balancing bold graphics with readable text helped my shape a design that was both playful yet functional. Working within the project timeline also pushed me to improve my time management and refine my designing process. <br>

        <i> <h3> SS'25 Fashion Magazine Design </i> &lpar;2025&rpar; by Phi Nguyen </h3>

        <p>
            In this Project, I designed a multi page magazine spread centered on clean layouts, editorial structure, and strong visual storytelling. I aimed to create work that was both modern and cohesive, requiring me to think carefully about how images, titles, and text blocks would interact with each other across each page. During the process, I gained practical experience using grid systems, text wrapping, and managing visual hierarchy on larger scale. Experimenting with typography and image placement had helped my understand how smaller adjustments such as spacing, readability, and contrast can dramatically shape the overall tone of a publication. Working under the project timeline also encouraged my to streamline my workflow and problem solve efficiently. <br>
